title: Headings
---
All HTML headings, <h1> through <h6>, are available. .h1 through .h6 classes are also available, for when you want to match the font styling of a heading but still want your text to be displayed inline.

Create lighter, secondary text in any heading with a generic <small> tag or the .small class.
